Hi there! Iâ€™m Okedi Alfred, a Software Engineer based in East Africa, Kampala.  I am currently working as a Developer advocate at [Africase](https://africase.org){:target="_blank"}.

I am also part of the [SMS One](https://smsone.co.ug) engineering team at [ICT Hub](https://niisp.ict.go.ug/innovation-hub){:target="_blank"} doing a whole lot of amazing things.

In 2023, I will be making 20 years since I wrote my first line of code.
